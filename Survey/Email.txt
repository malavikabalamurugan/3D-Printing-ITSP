Subject: Informal Survey regarding Teaching during Covid-19

Respected sir/ma'am

We are a team of UG students, who as part of the Institute Technical Summer Project, conducted by the Institute Technical Council, would like to conduct a short, informal, 5-question (MCQ) survey regarding the availability of online resources for teaching during Covid-19.

It is highly unlikely that the coming semester will see students returning to campus, and professors may have to conduct classes online. We understand that this might not be the preferred mode of instruction, and it can in no way be compared to a physical classroom. However, in these trying circumstance, all of us can try to ensure the best possible online-classroom experience for students. As part of our project, we would like to propose a solution that can aid professors in teaching online during the Lockdown:

We propose that professors outsource some of the technical and creative aspects of developing online teaching resources like Videos, Interactive Computer Programs, Computer Models etc. to students who are willing to collaborate with professors on the same.

We would like to gauge your interest in this proposal. You are requested to fill the survey below(it has only five MCQs, and will take less than a minute).

Thanking you for your time and for your response,

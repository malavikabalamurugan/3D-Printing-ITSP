# 3D-Printing-ITSP
Our project is aimed at developing online learning resources that include 3D models of topologically interesting shapes and surfaces across various disciplines. The idea behind the project is to create models that help visualise complex surfaces in higher dimensions and aid learning in online classrooms. You can view the models online in the .stl files present in the folders of the respective surfaces. You will also find images, python scripts and downloadable Fusion 360 files in these folders. We have developed models of Kein Bottles, MÃ¶bius Strips, wavefunctions of a one electron hydrogen atom, as well as ball and stick models of simple chemical compounds.

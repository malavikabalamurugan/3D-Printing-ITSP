 For this project i have attempted to make a model of a klein bottle using Fusion 360.
 This folder contains the .fd3 file containing the model on fusion 360 as well as an stl file where one can view an interactive model in 
 its solid and wireframe view.
 
 I have also included images of the rendered model, with a mesh and glass appearence so that this complex body can be viewed easily.

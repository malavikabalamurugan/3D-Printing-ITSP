# 3D-Printing-ITSP
Our project is aimed at developing 3D CAD Models of topologically interesting surfaces like MÃ¶bius Strips, Klein Bottles etc., with the aim of 3D Printing them. You can view the models online in the .stl files present in the folders of the respective surfaces. You will also find images and downloadable Fusion 360 files in these folders. We have also developed models of Wavefunctions of a one electron hydrogen atom, as well as ball and stick models of simple chemical compounds.
